# Jacobiâ€™s AlgorithmTo test the code,run the java class file named JacobiDriver.class.This class creates a new Jacobi object (a random 5X5 matrix on which all the methods can be called.) and gets the offB values. The program then graphs the points versus  the theoretical bound on a JFrame.Run the JacobianGraph program over again to see the different variations for various matrices.The class JacobiWithoutSortDriver.class will run the non-sorting version of the Algorithm.It not find the max off diagonal, but instead performs jacobi's algorithm on each off diagonal element.## ConclusionThere are two versions to the given algorithm, the sorting version and the non-sorting version. The sorting version of the program plots points which are either on or below the theoretical curve. The line of plotted points has a slope very close to the slope of the theoretical line.This program examines all off diagonal values in the upper right triangle, finds the maximum value of the off diagonals. Then the program performes jacobi's algorithm using that value.The non-sorting version executes jacobi's algorithm on each of the off diagonal values in the upper right section of the matrix in turn. After using each of the off diagonal values it starts with the first one until the OffB of the matrix is very accurate. This version took many more iterations to reach less than 10^-9.
